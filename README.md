# NetSentry-Machine-Learning-for-Network-Security
This project uses machine learning to detect computer security attacks by analyzing network traffic characteristics. The goal is to identify patterns in the data and determine the probability of an attack, using the UNRIDD dataset for intrusion detection.

This project aims to detect computer security attacks by analyzing the traffic characteristics of network connections. It will use machine learning techniques
to identify patterns in the data and determine the probability of an attack. 
The project is based on the UNRIDD dataset, which provides a set of network traffic data for intrusion detection. The goal is to detect attacks that 
compromise the availability, authority, confidentiality, and integrity of computing systems, which can be 
difficult to detect as they often look like normal traffic. By analyzing packet characteristics, port numbers, and protocols, 
the project will attempt to identify the stochastic traffic characteristics of attacks and use them to detect and prevent future attacks.
